# Explanation:
<p>name = input("What's your name? "): This line prompts the user to input their name. The entered value is stored in the variable name.</p>
<p>age = int(input("What's your age? ")): Here, the code prompts the user to input their age. The input() function is used to receive user input as a string. Then, int() is used to convert this string into an integer because age is typically represented by integers. The converted value is stored in the variable age.</p>
<p>print("Your name is {}, age is {}".format(name,age)): Here, the format() function is used to create a formatted string. The values of name and age are inserted into the curly braces {} within the string, replacing them with the values provided by the user. This formatted string is then printed to the output.</p>
